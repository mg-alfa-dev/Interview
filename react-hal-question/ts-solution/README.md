What we will be building
------------------------

We will be using [HAL Documents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Application_Language) to generate a simple React app for retrieving repositories and displaying details about the branch.  The final product will look something like this:

![Final app](mockups\react-dev-interview-question.gif)

We will *not* be building this from scratch, only creating a couple of the components and doing some data manipulation to generate the data.

Mockups of the various features are in `./mockups/` within the repository.

### Technologies

We'll be using [React Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/) via [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) for the store, [Carbon Components](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/) for some prebuilt/pre-styled components, and optionally [Material UI Styles](https://mui.com/styles/basics/) or [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/styled) for styling (you may also use css or sass).  We'll use [jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [@testing-library/react](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) for tests.

As this interview will also be pair programming, we encourage you to ask questions about the supplied features and workflows of these packages, rather than spending a lot of time searching the web and docs, though you are certainly welcome to read them during the interview if it helps.

The data from the "server" is retrieved via the `http-client` package at the root of the repository.  It is just a mock that returns expected results for given URLs, and does not connect to an external server.
